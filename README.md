# SAS-Generating-Assessing-and-Scoring-Predictive-Models
The FullFood supermarket wants to offer a newline of organic products. The supermarketâ€™s management would like to determine which customers are likely to purchase these products. The supermarket has a customer loyalty program. As an initial buyer incentive plan, the supermarket provided coupons for the organic products to all of its loyalty program participants and has collected data that includes whether or not these customers have purchased any of the organic products. The organic data warehouse contains over 22,223 observations and 13 variables.  Performed data exploration, transformation, replacing, imputing the data. Partitioned the data into three parts, train, validate and test based on a 40%, 30% and 30% scheme. Used decision tree, regression, neural network to predict which customers are likely to purchase organic products.  Used model comparision node to compare the models using misclassifications,lift charts, summary statistics, statistical graphics, ROC, score rankings plots OR other model comparison methods and created a profit matrix. Scored the final model with score node.
